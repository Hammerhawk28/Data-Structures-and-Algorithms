# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

This project seeked to store and organize courses for a university's computer science curriculum. In the provided files you will find a runtime analysis for this task using a vector, hash table, and binary search tree. Additionally, there is an example of what the code may look like in the source file using the binary search tree as the data structure. Pseudocode which is not included was first created for each data structure. This pseucdocode however may be seen in the runtime analsysis as it was used to evaluate line cost. Consideration of data strucutre before implementation is important as complexity, runtime, and memory allocation may greatly affect project outcome. This is one of the first projects I utilized pointers in and I believe I was able to do so very effectively. The course for which this project was created provided me a much better understanding of their use and power. Overall, I hope you fine the code concise, easy to follow, and well organized. As I continue to grow as a programmer I seek to provide short, clear, and concise coding as to improve its usability and maitanence.
